## Course info
During the semester you will have to complete a series of seven laboratory sessions. 
The course material is divided into notebooks, each dedicated to a specific topic.

A notebook is divided into exercises, each of which is worth a certain number of points.
At the end of the semester, the points from all notebooks will be summed up and converted into the final grade according

* 60 - 69 points: 3.5
