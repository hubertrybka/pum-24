    "\n",
    "It is a good practice to use Python type hints when defining functions. Type hints are a way to specify the expected types of the function arguments and the return value. This can help you catch bugs early and make your code easier to understand. For example, the function `get_median` can be defined as follows:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def get_median(numbers: list) -> float:\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "Python ignores these type hints, so they do not affect the performance of your code. However, they are an elegant way to document your code and make it more readable. By just looking at the definition, you can quickly understand what the function does and what kind of arguments it expects, thus making it easier to include your functions in larger projects. You can read more about type hints in the [official Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html)."

    "If you have successfully implemented the Game of Life, you can put all the functions into a single Python file `game_of_life.py`. You can then run the game from the command line by executing `python game_of_life.py`. You can use the `argparse` module from Python's standard library to parse command-line arguments and set the size of the board, the probability of a cell being alive, and the number of steps the simulation should run for. You can also use the `time` module to measure how long the simulation takes to run.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a new Python file `game_of_life.py` in the same directory as this notebook. Copy all relevant functions you implemented above into this file. Upon running the file, the Game of Life should be animated in the console. The user should be able to set the size of the board, the probability of a cell being alive, and the number of steps the simulation should run for.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of how to use `argparse` to pass arguments to a python script is given below:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import argparse\n",
    "\n",
    "parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()\n",
    "parser.add_argument(\"--size\", \"-s\", type=int, default=10, help=\"Size of the board\")\n",
    "parser.add_argument(\"--prob\", \"-p\", type=float, default=0.2, help=\"Probability of a cell being alive\")\n",
    "parser.add_argument(\"--steps\", \"-n\", type=int, default=20, help=\"Number of steps to run the simulation for\")\n",
    "\n",
    "args = parser.parse_args()\n",
    "args.size   # this will contain the size of the board\n",
    "args.prob   # this will contain the probability of a cell being alive\n",
    "args.steps  # this will contain the number of steps to run the simulation for\n",
    "\n",
    "...\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "If we wanted to run the simulation with a board of size 20, a probability of 0.3, and for 50 steps, we would run the script as follows:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python game_of_life.py --size 20 --prob 0.3 --steps 50\n",
    "```\n",
    " or:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python game_of_life.py -s 20 -p 0.3 -n 50\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You should also take a look at the [official Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html) for more information on how to use the `argparse` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** IPython's `clear_output` function will not work in the console, so instead of this, you can import the `os` module and use the `os.system('cls')` on Windows or `os.system('clear')` on Unix systems to clear the console output between each step.\n",
