    "In the previous exercises, you implemented the `Die` class and the `UnfairDie` class. The `UnfairDie` class is very similar to the `Die` class, but includes the `__init__` method and is a more general version of the `Die` class. This may be a good example of when to use **inheritance** in object-oriented programming.\n",

The class that inherits the properties of another class is called a **subclass** or **derived class**, and the class whose properties are inherited is called a **superclass** or **base class**.\n",

    "In Python, you can inherit from a class by passing the superclass as an argument to the class definition. We will create a new class called `Die` that inherits from the `UnfairDie` class. This way, we do not have to reimplement the `roll` and `roll_dice` methods, as they are already implemented in the `UnfairDie` class. **Remember that if you implement a method in a subclass that already exists in the superclass, the new method will override the old one.**\n",

    "Entropy is a measure of **uncertainity** or **randomness** in a random variable. \n",
    "You may have already heard about entropy in the context of thermodynamics, and if you did, you may see how those are related!\n",
    "The entropy of a discrete random variable $X$ with probability distribution $p(x)$ is defined as:\n",
    "$$H(X) = -\\sum_{x} p(x) \\log_2 p(x)$$\n",
    "Entropy is a **weighted average of the information content** of each possible value of $X$, where the weight is the **probability** of that value.\n",

    "$$H(X) = \\sum_{x} p(x) * \\log_2 \\frac{1}{p(x)}$$\n",

    "### Let's break it down:\n",
    "\n",
    "The term: $$\\log_2 \\frac{1}{p(x)}$$ is the **information content** or **surprisal** of the value $x$. For **high probability events** (such as the sun rising tomorrow) the surprisal is **low** (we get no new information about the system by observing the exact same sunrise for the 100th time), with $\\log_2 \\frac{1}{p(x)} = 0$ when $p(x) = 1$. For **low probability events**, such as your homework assignment being published in Nature, the surprisal is **high**, and $\\log_2 \\frac{1}{p(x)}$ goes to infinity as $p(x)\\to 0$. The graph below illustrates how the information content of an event $x$ changes for different values of $p(x)$.\n",

    "\n",
    "If you do not immediately see how this relates to the concept of a weighted average, note that $p(x) \\le 1$ and $\\sum_{x}{}{p(x)} = 1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hopefully, you can see that the formula for entropy satisfies some of our expectations when it comes to measuring surprisal of a random event.\n",
    "  \n",

    "$$= 0.5*\\log_2\\frac{1}{0.5} + 0.5*\\log_2\\frac{1}{0.5} = 1$$\n",
